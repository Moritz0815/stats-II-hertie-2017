**Course contents**

This course introduces students to an array of commonly used statistical techniques with a strong emphasis on actual application. All classes take place in the computer lab and divide time between theory and application. Students are assigned a problem set at the end of each class covering that day’s materials and the beginning of the following class is used to review the answers. As this is an applied class, most of these assignments involve the proper analysis of practice datasets using R. This class design is intended to provide students with both a theoretical and concrete understanding of statistical techniques. The course begins with a review of OLS regression and covers elementary time‐series and panel data, before introducing students to maximum likelihood estimation and some categorical data designs.
